<h4><strong>Average: 5/5</strong></h4>
<p><em>Evidence A:</em> Congo Basin forests - 2nd largest lungs of the world but at significant risk and requires global and regional actions. But area is also very important from a cultural and IPLC perspective</p>
<p><em>Evidence B:</em>The proponent proposes to work on three main forest ecosystems of the RDC that are globally critically important for biodiversity conservation. The areas considered by the proponent are irreplaceable and key in the context of nature-based solutions used to address climate change.</p>
<p><br></p>

<li><p>&gt;50 t/ha - Low;</p></li>

<p><em>Evidence B:</em>Two out of the three areas considered by the proponent are stocking high level of carbon.</p>

<div id="average-2.55" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Average: 2.5/5</strong></h4>
<p><em>Evidence A:</em> Large number of ICCAs of great importance for both people and nature. Area also embraces 7 National Parks, - total of 23 mill Ha under some form of protection. ICCAs will be key in term of connectivity and restoration. Should be completely under IPLC but richness (timber, mining) means government and private sector have big roles that may ignore IPLC territorial rights</p>
<p><em>Evidence B:</em>The proponent is proposing to work on the legal recognition of the role of the indigenous and local communities in the management of natural ecosystems by the government of the RDC.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4. Does the proposal explain the unique cultural significance of the area to IPLCs?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No explanation given of unique significance to IPLCs;</p></li>
<li><p>Significance of site(s) vaguely described;</p></li>

<h4><strong>Average: 2/2</strong></h4>
<p><em>Evidence A:</em> Yes - importance of ICCAs, WH sites and NPs - all make for an important mosaic. But they are under threat. Generally well described on the key roles of IPs in the area and how they are key to the long term BD conservation. Also points out importance of PAs and over 23 mil Ha under some form of conservation - many of these areas are or should be IPLC</p>
<p><em>Evidence B:</em>The cultural significance of the areas considered by the project in terms is well presented but is not very specific considering that three main forest ecosystems of RRDC are considered in the proposal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><u>C) Vulnerability of the proposed IPLCs as well as their lands/waters/natural resources to threats.</u></p>
<p>5. Is the area vulnerable to threats/current risk of negative impacts to IPLC and biodiversity without action?</p>

<li><p>Low threats;</p></li>

<p><em>Evidence A:</em> Timber logging - esp industrial (if there is logging it should be done by IPLCs; artisanal mining degrades land and water. NP and PAs have been gazetted without FPIC from IPLCs and so local people have been alienated. would seem clear that rights of IPLCs have been ignored in favour of State PAs and timber, mining, agriculture. illegal timber - esp industrial logging, mining, over exploitation of wildlife exacerbated by fact that PAs when gazetted ignore local IPLC management - especially their institutions</p>

<h4><strong>Average: 1/3</strong></h4>
<p><em>Evidence A:</em> IPLC governance mechanisms are in policy - but lack of implementation and support undermines their implementation. it is clear that IPLCs and their ICCAs need the governance strength to have their rights and responsibilities to their areas of land. Policy framework there - but is it really implemented - especially IPLC rights over valuable resources; and importance of sustainable use. Concept should now move to post Covid scenario (so no consumptive use of wild fauna). There are many ICCAs but not sure to what extent they are respected by Gov</p>

<p><em>Evidence A:</em> Support is there - but the issue is implementation. However political support from World Bank, GEF, GIZ and others might change this and better empower IPLC custodians. there is policy support but is it implemented. there are great opportunities for a large ICCA network to support both conservation and livelihoods</p>
<p><em>Evidence B:</em>There is some support from ICCN and sub-national governmental leaders (copies of the letters with the proposal), but more and stronger support will be needed for legal recognition for the management forest ecosystems to be passed on to indigenous people and communities in RDC.</p>
